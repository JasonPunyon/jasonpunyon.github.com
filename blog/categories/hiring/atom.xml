    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I read <a href="http://lockewatts.com/blog/2012/07/13/all-rockstars-went-to-julliard/">this</a> article today about how the tech industry is too elitist and thinks everyone who’s good is already rich and can follow their bliss until the cows come home waiting for the olympian software companies of the world to come hire them. I just wanted to provide a data point from Stack Exchange. I’m not gonna bloviate that we’re all rock stars at Stack Exchange (I wouldn’t even describe myself like that) but here’s the list of schools attended by all the programmers and sysadmins at Stack Exchange:</p>

<p>Georgia State University<br />
Arcadia University<br />
Metro State College of Denver<br />
Technische Universität Clausthal<br />
Duke<br />
Rice<br />
University of Texas<br />
University of Exeter<br />
Boston University<br />
University of New South Wales<br />
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute<br />
State University of New York at Geneseo (Plug: The <a href="http://www.geneseo.edu/physics">physics</a> department is awesome.)<br />
University of Pittsburgh<br />
Dartmouth<br />
Colorado State University<br />
New England Conservatory of Music<br />
Cleveland Conservatory of Music<br />
North Carolina State University (2)<br />
Washington University, St Louis.<br />
Montgomery County Community College<br />
Northern Territory University</p>

<p>You might notice a significant dearth of Ivy there. (And the one Ivy Leaguer we <em>do</em> have has been promoted to management so he doesn’t even code anymore. We still love him though :))</p>

<p>An underlying premise of Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange is that there’s tremendous amounts of knowledge tied up in “ordinary” people, and given an easy way to show it off and a little incentive they can make this knowledge available and help as many people as possible. Given Stack Exchange’s belief in the common (wo)?man it’s not surprising that the educational background of our programmers and system administrators is pretty…well, ordinary.</p>

<p>Locke setup up a straw man straw man by invoking Joel. I know he said the words “Ivy League” but Joel wasn’t really talking about the Ivy League. He was talking about <em>selectivity</em>. Specifically that as a sorting criteria a resume showed that the associated applicant had successfully navigated some process that was highly selective:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Selectivity</strong>. Another thing we look for on resumes is evidence that someone has gone through some highly selective process in the past. Not everyone at Ivy League schools is worth hiring, and not everyone at community college is worth avoiding, but getting into a very selective school does at least mean that someone, somewhere judged you using some kind of selection process and decided that you were pretty smart. Our company criterion for selectivity is usually getting into a school or program that accepts less than 30% of its applicants (there are about 60 schools in the US that meet this standard), or working for a company which is known to have a difficult application process, like a whole day of interviews. Highly selective branches of the military like officer’s training or pilot’s courses, or even just getting into the Marines indicates someone that has made it through some kind of difficult application/selection procedure and all in all this is a positive sign.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tech companies <em>are</em> looking outside the Ivy League and the Dan Shippers of the world for their “rock star” developers. I could list the previous positions of all the Stack Exchange programmers and sysadmins but I’ll save you the suspense: none of us were paying our bills running our own startups just waiting for something awesome like Stack Exchange to come along. In my case <a href="/blog/2012/05/15/how-i-got-my-dream-job-at-stack-exchange/"><em>I</em> sought <em>them</em> out</a> and quit my cushy yet crappy hedge fund job.</p>

<p>Complaining about how it’s not fair because they went to an Ivy League school and you didn’t or they started a company and you didn’t and these things makes their resume look better than yours isn’t going to get you very far, though. You have to make it easy for employers to choose you from the pile of resumes. You know there’s competition out there for these jobs. If you want to work at a start up you have know you’re going up against some of the best in the industry and you have to make yourself stand out.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Your resume (or your <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jasonpunyon">Careers 2.0 profile</a>) has the single purpose of <em>showing</em> them you’re worth it. It has to <em>make</em> them believe you’re worth calling for an interview. Provide some <strong>evidence</strong>. Don’t have any? You’re a programmer…manufacture some! Make a blog. Write a ruby gem. Answer some questions on Stack Overflow. Write some code for a charity. Make a website for your band. This stuff won’t take forever to do. It isn’t like the old days where you had to apprentice with a master furniture maker for a decade to get some cred. The medium you work in allows you to make things in days, not years. It doesn’t have to change the world, it just has to give the person looking at your resume a reason to choose you instead of the other g(al</td>
      <td>uy).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Just in case you’re in the market and looking to stand out…we built <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com">Careers 2.0</a> to help you stand out by enabling you to show off your programmery stuff. It’s invitation only so if you’d like an invite just tweet me <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonpunyon">@JasonPunyon</a> and I’ll hook you up. You may not have gone to an Ivy League school but if you can show off some evidence that you’ve got skills you rank up there with the best of the Yalees and Browners. You’ve got a section for open source projects hosted at Github, Bitbucket, Code Plex or Source Forge. There’s a section for Apps you’ve written. Write a blog or read any good books lately? Choose your favorites and show them off. When employers search the Careers database for candidates with particular skills we take all of this stuff into account and sort you accordingly.</p>

<p>Also! We’re always looking for great developers to come work with us at Stack Exchange. Don’t let what school you went to keep you from <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/16279/software-developer-new-york-stack-exchange">applying today</a> (we’ll even take you Ivy Leaguers).</p>

<p>Oh and again, if you’re into physics…GO TO GENESEO…if only to watch Dr. Fletcher’s valiant yearly attempts to demonstrate quantum tunneling by running full speed towards the classroom wall. He hasn’t succeeded yet, but if he tries long enough probability says…</p>

    <id>http://jasonpunyon.com/blog/2012/05/12/employee-referral-bonuses-are-pants-on-head-stupid-follow-up</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href="/blog/2012/05/11/employee-referral-bonuses-are-pants-on-head-stupid/">previous post</a> I outlined one reason why I think employee referral bonuses aren’t good: They distort the incentives for referring someone into the company in a way that can’t possibly be good. First off, my thanks go out to everyone who read that post. Some people refuted my argument in various ways and I thought I’d take a look at a couple of them.</p>

<h3 id="refutation-the-first-bonus-size-matters">Refutation The First: Bonus Size Matters</h3>

<p>This is correct. I was working under the scenario of the <a href="http://jzhwu.blogspot.com/2012/05/im-former-miso-engineer-and-founders.html">miso article</a> where the bonus was $10,000. The size of the bonus absolutely matters. The bonus can’t distort any incentives if it’s too small for people to care about. But that’s the problem then. It’s too small for people to care about. The promise of $500 ($350 after taxes?) six months from hire date is not enough to divert your employee’s attention from their primary responsibilities to do this recruiting work for you.</p>

<p>If you also use contingency recruiters (you shouldn’t, but I realize companies still do) another problem that might exist with relatively small referral bonuses is you can’t simultaneously have GIANT contingency recruiter fees that your employees know about. If a contingency recruiter gets $25K on a $100K salaried worker when your employee gets $500 or $1000 for the same kind of referral your employee is going to see the dissonance there and be unhappy.</p>

<p>Another dissonance your employees might see is that the company says things like “We are 100% dedicated to finding great talent. It is #1 with a bullet on our list of priorities” and then you pay out $500 for a referral. It just doesn’t jive.</p>

<h3 id="refutation-the-second-risk-vs-reward">Refutation The Second: Risk vs. Reward</h3>

<p>Another popular thought was that referring someone to the company carries with it the inherent risk that the hire doesn’t work out. When the hire doesn’t work out it’s the referrer that would be “blamed” for the failure and that the bonus compensates them for that risk. This was interesting and I have to admit that I didn’t consider framing the issue like this at all.</p>

<p>Your employee who refers a potential hire doesn’t get the bonus until the potential hire is hired and stays for a honeymoon period of 3 or 6 months.  The honeymoon period is there to protect the company from paying out a bonus and then having the new hire quit after 3 weeks. So when the new hire doesn’t work out during the honeymoon period, the referrer gets both the “blame” <strong>and</strong> no bonus. The bonus can’t possibly compensate them for any risk during the honeymoon period.</p>

<p>The honeymoon period simultaneously sends the message “Once the new hire makes it out of the honeymoon period, we’re happy with your referral performance. Let’s celebrate with some rewards.”  If the new hire makes it out of the period, and then something doesn’t work out, the company <em>can’t</em> with a straight face blame the referrer for anything. It’s simply schizophrenic. If you’re doing it right, there isn’t any blame risk to compensate them for after the honeymoon period is over.</p>

<p>So during the honeymoon period the referrer can’t possibly be compensated for the risk, and after the honeymoon period there isn’t any risk for which to compensate the referrer if the company isn’t being schizophrenic.</p>

<p>Side note: This analysis was done under the pretense that there’s this blame game being played. If there’s any of this going on at all there is a <strong>serious</strong> problem that needs to be remedied immediately. The company can’t attach this nebulous liability to the referrer for a person <em>the company</em> hired. The company should still put the referred candidate through their paces in the interview process and prove to themselves that the recommendation was justified. In doing so the company can’t possibly place blame at the foot of the referrer for providing what is essentially an introduction.</p>

    <link href="http://jasonpunyon.com/blog/2012/05/11/employee-referral-bonuses-are-pants-on-head-stupid/"/>
    <updated>2012-05-11T06:59:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jasonpunyon.com/blog/2012/05/11/employee-referral-bonuses-are-pants-on-head-stupid</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, I read <a href="http://jzhwu.blogspot.com/2012/05/im-former-miso-engineer-and-founders.html">this</a> story yesterday about the employee who referred a friend and got screwed out of his referral bonus. People on Hacker News argued about “Name and Shame” and who was right and wrong but the first thought that popped into my head was “employee referral bonuses are pants on head stupid.”</p>

<p>Forget about this particular case and the collateral problems it’s causing. The employee referral bonus is just an intrinsically bad idea. Ostensibly the bonus exists to reward an employee for referring someone into a job. All it really does is distort the incentives in a way that can’t possibly be good.</p>

<p>Following is a list of reasons I want an employee of mine referring someone to my company:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The person being referred is beyond awesome at what they do and we’d be fools not to hire them.</li>
  <li>Did you not read #1?</li>
</ol>

<p>When I hold a $10,000 gun to the referrer’s head I’m distracting them from that <strong>one</strong> simple reason. When there’s no bonus involved there are people the employee will refer and people they won’t. With the money hanging out there a third category of people opens up: people the employee will refer if they can get $10,000. This third category is made up completely from the people the employee wouldn’t have referred if the bonus didn’t exist. I don’t want any of these people in the third category.</p>

<p>The absolute <strong>last</strong> thing I want to do is turn my employees into contingency recruiters and that’s exactly what the referral bonus does.</p>

<p>So if referral bonuses aren’t right how <em>do</em> you get your employees to refer great talent to the company and the company to great talent?  Make your company such an awesome place to be and work that your employees naturally want to do that.  Figure out what your employees want and then <strong>give it to them</strong>.  Great health care, free lunch, 20% time…whatever.  They’ll be so happy with you that they won’t be able to contain themselves when they find out a friend is looking for a job.</p>
