    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After all the rave reviews of my last post I knew you were just on the edge of your seat waiting to hear more about my little unsupervised text anomaly detector.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/94aVQ7k.png"><img class="center" src="http://i.imgur.com/94aVQ7k.png" /></a>

<p>So, we’ve got some <a href="http://jasonpunyon.com/blog/2014/09/02/a-wild-anomaly-appears/">working ML</a>! Our job’s done right?</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/aSHZLkH.png"><img class="center" src="http://i.imgur.com/aSHZLkH.png" /></a></p>

<p>‘Round these parts, it ain’t shipped ‘til it’s fast <em>and</em> it’s got it’s own chat bot. We spend all day in chat and there’s a cast of characters we’ve come to know, and love, and hate.</p>

<h2 id="pinbot">Pinbot</h2>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/qaqcvek.png"><img class="center" src="http://imgur.com/qaqcvek.png" /></a></p>

<p>Pinbot helps us not take each other’s database migrations. You can say “taking ###” and Pinbot removes the last taken migration from this room’s pins and replaces it with this one. So we always know what migration we’re up to, even if someone hasn’t pushed it yet. Also pictured: Me calling myself a dumbass in the git logs. Which gets broadcast by our TeamCity bot. Someone starred it.</p>

<h2 id="hair-on-fire">Hair on Fire</h2>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/yt2rLV4.png"><img class="center" src="http://i.imgur.com/yt2rLV4.png" /></a></p>

<p>Hair on fire bot helps Careers keep making money. Hair on fire pops up every now and again to tell us a seriously critical error that affects the bottom line has happened on the site. If someone is buying something or on their way to buying something and gets an exception Hair On Fire dumps the details directly to chat so someone can get to work immediately.</p>

<h2 id="logobot">LogoBot</h2>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/CGCeY9l.png"><img class="center" src="http://i.imgur.com/CGCeY9l.png" /></a></p>

<p>Here’s another little Careers helper. We have a policy that any advertising images that go up on Stack Overflow <em>must</em> be reviewed by a real live person. When display advertising is purchased from our ad sales/ad operations teams, they do it. When we introduced <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/products/company-pages">Company Page Ads</a> we automated the process of getting images on Stack Overflow and no one had to talk to a sales person. This begat LogoBot who reminds us to do our job and make sure no one’s putting up animated gifs or other such tawdriness.</p>

<h2 id="malfunctioning-eddie">Malfunctioning Eddie</h2>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/KvswKSK.png"><img class="center" src="http://i.imgur.com/KvswKSK.png" /></a></p>

<p>Malfunctioning Eddie’s…got problems.</p>

<h2 id="anomaly-bot">Anomaly Bot</h2>

<p>Which brings me to the Anomaly bot. We need to make sure that all these anomalous jobs I’m detecting get in front of the sales support team. They are the human layer of detectors I alluded to in my last post who used to have to check over every single job posted to the board.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZJDszbV.png"><img class="center" src="http://i.imgur.com/ZJDszbV.png" /></a></p>

<p>There it is. Anomaly bot. Where does it lead us puny humans?</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/zBsNv8n.png"><img class="center" src="http://i.imgur.com/zBsNv8n.png" /></a></p>

<p>Welcome to the super secret admin area of Careers. At the top of the page we have a list of the jobs that were posted today. There are 3 columns, the anomaly score (which is based solely on title), the job title, and a few buttons to mark the job anomalous or not. The second section of the page is for all jobs currently on the board.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/6WOgbJV.png"><img class="center" src="http://i.imgur.com/6WOgbJV.png" /></a></p>

<p>I’m hoping the heatmap pops out at you. It runs from Red (pinned to the all-time most anomalous job) to Green (pinned to the all-time most middle-of-the-road job ever). The jobs posted today are light orange at worst, so that’s pretty good! On the “all jobs” list there’s a bunch of red that we need to review.</p>

<p>Just to give a reference, here was the first version sans heatmap.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/qawGqwB.png"><img class="center" src="http://i.imgur.com/qawGqwB.png" /></a></p>

<p>So much more information in that tiny extra bit of color. If you want to make simple heatmaps it’s really easy to throw together some javascript that uses <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/340209/generate-colors-between-red-and-green-for-a-power-meter/340214">the power of HSL</a>.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>We’re gonna let this marinate for a while to actually test my hypothesis that we only have to look at the top 10% of jobs by anomaly score. The sales support team’s gonna clear the backlog in the “all jobs” section of the report, then use the tool for a little while and then we’ll have the data we need to actually set the threshold. Once we do that the Anomaly bot can get a little smarter. Right now Anomaly bot just shows every three hours with that same dumb message. Maybe it’ll only show up when there’s jobs above our human-trained threshold (modulo a safety factor). Maybe we’ll change it to pop up as soon as an anomalous job gets posted on the board.</p>

<h2 id="here-have-some-code">Here, have some code</h2>

<p>If you want to use the very code we’re using right now to score the job titles it’s up on <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/AnomalousText/">Nuget</a>, and the source is on <a href="https://github.com/JasonPunyon/AnomalousText">Github</a></p>

    <id>http://jasonpunyon.com/blog/2014/09/02/a-wild-anomaly-appears</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, I’m working on the new Data Team at <a href="http://stackexchange.com">Stack Exchange</a> now. Truth is we have no idea what we’re doing (<a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/62161/data-science-engineer-stack-exchange">WANNA JOIN US?</a>). But every now and then we come across something that works a little too well and wonder why we haven’t heard about it before.</p>

<p>We run a <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs">niche job board for programmers</a> that has about 2900 jobs on it this morning. Quality has been pretty easy to maintain. We have a great spam filter called “The $350 Price Tag”. Then we have some humans that look over the jobs that get posted looking for problems. Overall the system works well, but at 2900 jobs a month that means someone has to look through about 150 jobs every working day. They’re looking for a needle in a haystack as most (&gt;95%) of the jobs posted are perfectly appropriate for the board, so there’s a lot of “wasted” time spent looking for ghosts that aren’t there. And it’s pretty boring to boot. I’m sure that person would rather do other things with their time.</p>

<p>It’d be nice if we had an automated way of dealing with this. We have no idea what we’re doing, so we frequently just reach into our decidedly meager bag of tricks, pull one out, and try it on a problem. I’d done that a few times before on this problem, trying Naive Bayes or Regularized Logistic Regression, but had gotten nowhere. There are a lot of different ways a job can be appropriate for the board and there are a lot of different ways a job could be not appropriate for the board which makes coming up with a representative training set difficult.</p>

<p>Last week while taking another whack at the problem I Googled “Text Anomaly” and came across David Guthrie’s 186 page Ph. D. thesis, <a href="http://nlp.shef.ac.uk/Completed_PhD_Projects/guthrie.pdf">Unsupervised Detection of Anomalous Text</a>. There’s a lot there, but the novel idea was simple enough (and it worked in his experiments and mine) that I’m surprised I haven’t heard about it until now.</p>

<h3 id="distance-to-the-textual-complement">Distance to the Textual Complement</h3>

<p>Say you have a bunch of documents. You pull one out and want to determine how anomalous it is with respect to all the others. Here’s what you do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose some features to characterize the document in question.</li>
  <li>Convert the document to its feature representation.</li>
  <li>Treat all the other documents as one giant document and convert that to its feature representation.</li>
  <li>Calculate the distance between the two.</li>
</ol>

<p>Do this for every document and sort the results descending by the distance calculated in step 4. The documents at the top of the list are the “most anomalous”.</p>

<p>That’s it. Pretty simple to understand and implement. There are two choices to make: which features, and which distance metric to use.</p>

<h2 id="obscurity-of-vocabulary-i-choose-you">Obscurity of Vocabulary, I choose you!</h2>

<p>In any machine learning problem you have to come up with features to characterize the set of things you’re trying to work on. This thesis is chock full of features, 166 of them broken up into a few different categories. This part of the paper was a goldmine for me (remember, I have no idea what I’m doing). The text features I knew about before this were word counts, frequencies, tf-idf and maybe getting a little into part of speech tags. The kinds of features he talks about are stuff I never would’ve come up with on my own. If you’re doing similar work and are similarly lost, take a look there for some good examples of feature engineering.</p>

<p>The set of features that stood out to me the most were the ones in a section called “Obscurity of Vocabulary Usage”. The idea was to look at a giant reference corpus and rank the words in the corpus descending by frequency. Then you make lists of the top 1K, 5K, 10K, 50K, etc. words. Then you characterize a document by calculating the percentages of the document’s words that fall into each bucket.</p>

<h2 id="manhattan-distance-i-choose-you">Manhattan Distance, I choose you!</h2>

<p>Guthrie pits a bunch of distance metrics against eachother and for Distance to the Textual Complement method the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry">Manhattan distance</a> got the blue ribbon, so I used that.</p>

<h1 id="setup">Setup</h1>

<p>When I’ve been looking through the jobs before I can pretty much tell by their titles whether they’re busted or not, so my documents were just the job titles. There isn’t really a good reference corpus from which to build the Top-N word lists, so I just used the job titles themselves. I tried a couple different sets of Ns but ended up on 100, 300, 1000, 3000, and 10000 (Really ~7,000 as that’s the number of unique terms in all job titles).</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/UxtpK5K.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UxtpK5K.png" /></a></p>

<h1 id="results">Results</h1>

<p>Here’s the sort of all the jobs that were on the board yesterday.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/tfdPgaE.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tfdPgaE.png" /></a></p>

<p>Basically everything on the right is good and has low scores (distances).</p>

<p>Most of the jobs on the left have something anomalous in their titles. Let’s group up the anomalies by the reasons they’re broken and look over some of them.</p>

<h4 id="stuff-that-just-aint-right">Stuff that just ain’t right</h4>

<p>These jobs just don’t belong on the board. We need to follow up with these people and issue refunds.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Supervisor Commercial Administration Fox Networks Group</li>
  <li>Sales Executive Risk North Americas</li>
  <li>Associate Portfolio Manager Top Down Research</li>
  <li>Senior Actuarial Pre-Sales Consultant</li>
  <li>Ad Operations Coordinator</li>
  <li>NA Customer Service Representative for Sungard Energy</li>
  <li>Manager, Curation</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="just-terrible-titles">Just Terrible Titles</h4>

<p>These jobs would belong, but the titles chosen were pretty bad. Misspellings, too many abbreviations, etc. We need to follow up with our customers about these titles to improve them.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Javascript Devlopers Gibraltar</li>
  <li>Sr Sys Admin Tech Oper Aux Svcs</li>
  <li>VR/AR Developer</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="duplicate-information">Duplicate Information</h4>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lUUTeNX.png" alt="Duplicate Information" /></p>

<p>Anywhere you see the title for a job on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> or <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com">Careers</a> we also show you things like the location of the job, whether it’s remote or not, and the company’s name. These titles duplicate that information. We need to follow up with our customers to improve them.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Delivery Manager, Trade Me, New Zealand</li>
  <li>Visualization Developer, Calgary</li>
  <li>Technical Expert Hyderabad</li>
  <li>Technical Expert Pune</li>
  <li>Technical Expert Chennai</li>
  <li>Technical Expert Gurgaon</li>
  <li>New York Solutions Architect</li>
  <li>Sr Fullstack Eng needed for Cargurus We reach over 10MM unique visitors monthly</li>
  <li>Sr. Tester, Sky News, West London</li>
  <li>Chief Information Officer/CIO Audible.com</li>
  <li>Machine Learning Engineer Part Time Remote Working Available</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-about-the-false-positives">What about the false positives?</h2>

<p>A number of false positives are produced (this is just a sample):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Computer Vision Scientist</li>
  <li>Mac OSX Guru</li>
  <li>Angularjs + .NET + You</li>
  <li>Android Developer 100% Boredom Free Zone</li>
  <li>Java Developer 100% Boredom Free Zone</li>
  <li>DevOps Engineer - Winner, Hottest DC Startups!!! $10M Series A</li>
  <li>Jr. Engineer at Drizly</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of these (Computer Vision, Mac OSX) are just infrequently found on our board. Some of these people are trying to be unique (and are successful, by this analysis) so that their listing stands out.</p>

<p>Guthrie goes into a bit of detail about this in a section on precision and recall in the paper. His conclusion is that this kind of anomaly detection is particularly suited to when you have a human layer of detectors as the last line of defense and want to reduce the work they have to do. An exhaustive exploration of the scores finds that all of the jobs we need to follow up on are in the top 10% when ordered descending by their anomaly scores. Setting that threshold should cut the job our humans have to do by 90%, making them happier and less bored, and improving the quality of the job board.</p>
